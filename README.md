# AWS DeepRacer Robomaker Image
This repository contains the extracts from the AWS DeepRacer Robomaker simapp; including
* the environment and tracks
* the robotics agent code ('markov')
* Dockerfile

## Available pre-built versions

In most cases it will be sufficient to use one of our pre-built images which use optimized Tensorflow binaries. Depending on how modern processor you have available you can pick which instruction sets to use.
* AVX is available on most Intel Core processors from the second generation on - running DeepRacer on an older processor really does not make sense; hence we do not have pre-built images without this instruction set.
* AVX2 is available on more modern Intel Core processors; starting from the Haswell architecture (4th generation), and is probably the image most will use.
* AVX-512 was available on newer Xeon and Core i7-X processors. Due to convergence issues it has been removed.
* GPU uses Tensorflow-GPU instead of CPU. It is not compiled with special instruction sets for the CPU.

The built image is available via `docker pull awsdeepracercommunity/deepracer-robomaker:cpu`. For other images replace `cpu` with the tag of your choice from the above table.

## Building the image

To build the CPU image run `docker build -t awsdeepracercommunity/deepracer-robomaker:cpu -f docker/Dockerfile.cpu . --build-arg TENSORFLOW_VER='tensorflow==1.11.0`

To build the GPU image run `docker build -t awsdeepracercommunity/deepracer-robomaker:gpu -f docker/Dockerfile.gpu . `

To add a custom tensorflow library run `docker build -t awsdeepracercommunity/deepracer-robomaker:cpu -f docker/Dockerfile.cpu . --build-arg TENSORFLOW_VER=<http-url-to-file>`

### Tensorflow build

Tensorflow has been built with the following parameters:
* `cpu-avx` with `-march=x86-64 -maes -mavx -mmmx -mpclmul -mpopcnt -msse -msse2 -msse3 -msse4.1 -msse4.2 -mssse3`
* `cpu-avx2` with `-march=x86-64 -maes -mavx -mavx2 -mmmx -mpclmul -mpopcnt -msse -msse2 -msse3 -msse4.1 -msse4.2 -mssse3 -mf16c -mfma`
